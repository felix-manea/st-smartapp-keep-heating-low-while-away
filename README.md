# Keep heating low while away (Smartthings groovy SmartApp)
This is a groovy smart app for Smartthings that keeps heating between a temperature interval while selected presence sensors are away.
You can set the following:
- multiple presence sensors (when they are all not present, the script will start)
- a temperature sensor
- a switch-based heater
- minimum temperature
- maximum temperature
- if it should send push messages through the mobile app

Any thoughts for improving this script are welcome :)

Note: Don't ask for SMS notifications as I will not add.
